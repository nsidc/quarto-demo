# About

## About Quarto

⌨️ Written in TypeScript.

❤️ Very responsive development team.

_TODO: More!_


## Quarto vs. Jupyter ecosystem

* Quarto is focused on publishing to many formats (via Pandoc).
    * Competes with JupyterBook, which is less mature.
* Quarto uses Jupyter under the hood to perform computations.

::: {.notes}
I've opened four issues with Quarto so far, and community has been extremely
supportive. Two bugs were fixed right away, one bug was scheduled for a future
milestone, and the fourth was user error.

## Quarto vs. Jupyter notebooks

* Quarto uses Computational Markdown as its input format, so it's easier to
  version-control.

## GitHub Actions / GitHub Pages prep-work

![GitHub Pages setup](/_media/github-pages-setup.png)

::: {.notes}
For simplicity, I prefer to use the "GitHub Actions" method rather than the
"Deploy from a branch" method to keep my repository history free of output
artifacts.

## GitHub Action workflow definition

Quarto provides out-of-the-box GitHub Actions you can use to publish for free
to GitHub Pages.

* Great for basic use cases.
* You'll need custom actions if your Quarto document(s) require third-party libraries.
