# About

## About Quarto

⌨️ Written in TypeScript.

❤️ Very responsive development team.

📤 Focused on publishing: websites, books, PDFs, slide decks.

✍️ Authoring in Markdown.


## Examples

* Performs computations (requires Jupyter dependency): 

  ```{python}
  #| echo: true
  import math
  math.tau > math.pi
  ```

* Renders rich text:

  $$\large\tau > \pi$$

* Renders many output formats (_like this slide deck!_)

## Quarto vs. Jupyter ecosystem

* Quarto is focused on publishing to many formats (via Pandoc).
    * Competes with JupyterBook, which is less mature.
* Quarto uses Jupyter under the hood to perform computations.

::: {.notes}
I've opened four issues with Quarto so far, and community has been extremely
supportive. Two bugs were fixed right away, one bug was scheduled for a future
milestone, and the fourth was user error.
:::


## Quarto vs. Jupyter notebooks

* Both are [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)
  tools.
* Quarto uses Computational Markdown as its input format, so it's easier to
  version-control.
* _TODO: More!_

## GitHub Actions / GitHub Pages prep-work

![GitHub Pages setup](/_media/github-pages-setup.png)

::: {.notes}
For simplicity, I prefer to use the "GitHub Actions" method rather than the
"Deploy from a branch" method to keep my repository history free of output
artifacts.
:::


## GitHub Action workflow definition

Quarto provides out-of-the-box GitHub Actions you can use to publish for free
to GitHub Pages.

* Great for basic use cases.
* You'll need custom actions if your Quarto document(s) require third-party libraries.

[Example](https://github.com/nsidc/quarto-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish-to-github-pages.yml)


# Fin

We'd love suggestions on how to best present Quarto to a non-developer audience.
