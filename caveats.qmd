# Caveats

::: {.callout-note}
This list of caveats is incomplete. PRs accepted ðŸ˜€
:::

* Quarto is _new_, but it's moving fast and the dev team is very responsive to
  feedback/requests.
* Using Python 3.11, you will receive `Debugger warning: It seems that frozen
  modules are being used, ...`
* Figure captions are finicky. Sometimes the figure caption will not render. See
  [https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3525](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/3525).


## Hot reloading `preview` server

* Sometimes output directories (`.quarto`, `_site`) need to be deleted, e.g.
  when changing branches.


## PDF Rendering

* Requires a LaTeX distribution; [read
  more](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-engine.html). This will
  cause challenges when installing Quarto with Conda.
* Won't work with interactive features Jupyter supports, like interactive
  representation of objects (e.g. Xarray).
